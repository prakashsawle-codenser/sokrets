Introduction \nPure air is a mixture of various gases such as nitr ogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and small \namount  of  other  gases  in  a  fixed  proportion.  If  the   composition  of  air  alters  by  any  means;  it  is \nknown as air pollution, which can lead to effects o n human health, environment, and other living \ncreatures. According to The Air (Prevention and Con trol of Pollution) Act, 1981, “air pollution is \nthe presence of any solid, liquid, or gaseous subst ance in the atmosphere in such concentration as \nmay  be or tend to be injurious to human beings or o ther living  creatures or plants or property or \nenvironment”.  \nAir pollution has now become a serious issue of con cern and many of the  countries in the world \nsuch  as  Pakistan,  Iran,  India,  UAE,  and  China  etc.  are  formulating  strategies  to  deal  with  it. \nThere  are  a  number  of  factors  responsible  for  the  a ltered  composition  of  the  ambient  air  which \ncan be mainly categorised as natural causes and ant hropogenic (man-made) causes. 	\n2. Sources of air pollution 	\nNatural sources:  Natural sources  of  air pollution include volcanic  activity,  dust,  sea-salt, forest \nfires, lightening, soil outgassing  etc. \nAnthropogenic  sources:   These  sources  include  stationary  point  sources  ( e.g.  emission  from \nindustries),  mobile  sources  ( e.g.  vehicular  emission,  marine  vessels,  airplanes  etc.),  waste \ndisposal landfills, open burning  etc. 	\n3. Air pollutants 	\nThe substances which are responsible for causing ai r pollution are called as air pollutants.  \n3.1 Classification of air pollutants  \nAir pollutants can be categorized by various means:  \n 	\nAir Pollution\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	3 	\n3.1.1 On the basis of source of origin	 \n1.  Natural  air  pollutants:  Natural  air  pollutants  are  emitted  from  natural  sources  such  as \nvolcanic activity, dust, sea-salt, forest fires, li ghtening, soil outgassing etc. \n2.  Anthropogenic  air  pollutants:  These  pollutants  incl ude  the  emissions  from  stationary \npoint  sources  ( e.g.  emission  from  industries),  mobile  sources  ( e.g.  vehicular  emission, \nmarine vessels, airplanes  etc.), waste disposal landfills, controlled burning  etc. \n3.1.2 On the basis of method of origin\n \n1.  Primary  air  pollutants:  Those  pollutants  which  are  emitted  directly  from  any  emission \nsource in the atmosphere are termed as primary air  pollutants, e.g. sulphur dioxide (SO	\n2), \ncarbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), ammonia (NH	\n3)  etc.  \n2.  Secondary  air  pollutants:  Secondary  pollutants  are  formed  by  the  reactions  between \nprimary  air  pollutants  and  normal  atmospheric  const ituents.  In  some  of  the  cases,  these \npollutants are formed by utilizing the solar energy , e.g.  ozone, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), \nsmog  etc. \n3.1.3 On the basis of chemical composition	\n \n1.  Organic  air  pollutants:  Examples  are  hydrocarbons,  aldehydes,  ketones,  amines,  and \nalcohols  etc. \n2.  Inorganic air pollutants:  Examples are  carbon compo unds (CO and  carbonates), nitrogen \ncompounds  (NO	\nX  and  NH	3),  sulphur  compounds  (H	2S,  SO	2,  SO	3,  H	2SO	4),  halogen \ncompounds (HF, HCl  etc.), flyash, silica  etc. \n3.1.4 On the basis of state of matter	\n \n1.  Gaseous air  pollutants:  Pollutants which are in the  form of  gas are termed as  gaseous  air \npollutants,  e.g. SO	\n2, NO	X, O	3, CO  etc. \n2.  Particulate  air  pollutants:  Particulate  air  polluta nts  or  particulate  matter  (PM)  can  be \ndefined  as  the  microscopic  solid  or  liquid  matter  s uspended  in  the  earth’s  atmosphere. \nThere are various subtypes of particulate matter:\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	4 	\na.  Total  suspended  particulate  matter  (TSPM):  The  conc entration  of  particulate  matter \nwhich  is  obtained  when  a  high  volume  bulk  sampling  is  done  on  a  filter  substrate.  It \nincludes particles of all sizes. \nb.   PM	\n10: These are the particles less than 10 µ m in diamet er \nc.   PM\n2.5: These are the particles less than 2.5 µ m in diame ter \nd.   PM\n1.0: These are the particles less than 1 µ m in diamete r \nParticles  which  lie  between  10µ m  to  2.5µ m  are  terme d  as  ‘coarse  particles’  whereas  particles \nwith diameter less  than 2.5µ m are called as ‘fine  p articles’.  Fine particles  also  include ultra-fine \nparticles of size less than 0.1 µ m (PM	\n0.1).  \n3.2 Criteria pollutants  \nAccording  to  the  US  Environmental  Protection  Agency   (EPA),  criteria  pollutants  are  the \nparticulate  air  pollutants,  photochemical  oxidants  and  ground  level  ozone,  carbon  monoxide, \nsulphur  oxides,  nitrogen  oxides,  and  lead.  These  po llutants  are  responsible  for  causing  serious \nhealth  hazards,  environmental  hazards  such  as  smog,   acid  rain,  and  property  damage etc.  These \npollutants are termed as  criteria pollutants becaus e as per the Clean Air Act, 1963, US EPA sets \nnational  ambient  air  quality  standards  for  them  bas ed  on  the  human  health-based  and/or \nenvironmentally-based  criteria  (characterizations  o f  scientific  information).  The  sources  and \neffects of criteria pollutants are shown in the Tab le 1. \nTable 1: Criteria air pollutants – emission sources  and major effects   \nCriteria \npollutants  Emission sources  Major effects 	\nNatural \nsources  Anthropogenic \nsources  Health effects  Environmental \neffects 	\nSulfur  \ndioxide  \n(SO	\n2) Volcanic  \nemissions \nBurning  of  fossil \nfuels,  metal  \nsmelting,  petroleum  \nrefining \netc.  Respiratory \nproblems,  heart  and  \nlung  disorders,  \nvisual impairment  Acid rain  	\nNitrogen  \ndioxide \n(NO	\n2) \nLightning,  \nforest  fires  \netc.\n  Burning  of  fossil  \nfuels,  biomass  and  \nhigh  temperature  Pulmonary  \ndisorders,  increased  \nsusceptibility  to Precursor  of  ozone  \nformation  in  \ntroposphere,  aerosol\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	5 	\ncombustion  \nprocesses  respiratory \ninfections formation 	\nParticulate  \nmatter  \n(PM) Windblown  \ndust,  pollen  \nspores,  \nphotochemic\nally produced \nparticles  Vehicular  emissions,  \nindustrial  \ncombustion  \nprocesses, \ncommercial  and \nresidential \ncombustion, \nconstruction  \nindustries  Respiratory  \nproblems,  liver  \nfibrosis,  lung/liver  \ncancer, heart stroke, \nbone problems \nVisibility reduction \nCarbon  \nmonoxide  \n(CO) \nAnimal  \nmetabolism,  \nforest  fires, \nvolcanic \nactivity   Burning  of  \ncarbonaceus  fuels,  \nemission  from  IC \nengines \nAnoxemia  leading  \nto  various  \ncardiovascular \nproblems.

National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) \nConsidering  the  serious  impacts  caused  by  air  pollu tants,  their  effective  management  becomes \ninevitable.  Therefore,  to  monitor  and  control  of  va rious  air  pollutants,  Central  Pollution  Control \nBoard  (CPCB)  has  been  provided  with  various  powers  and  functions  under  the  Air  (Prevention \nand  Control  of  Pollution)  Act,  1981.  Subsequent  to  this,  CPCB  had  launched  a  nationwide \nprogram  viz.  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Monitoring  Programme  (NAAQM)  in  1984,  which \nhas  been  renamed  as  National  Air  Quality  Monitoring   Programme  (NAMP).  The  number  of \noperating  monitoring  stations  under  NAMP  has  increa sed  steadily  to  614  by  2016  covering  254 \ncities  across  the  nation  (29  states  and  5  UTs).  Und er  this  programme,  there  are  10  monitoring \nstations  functioning  in  Delhi.  Moreover,  under  the  NAMP,  three  major  pollutants viz.  sulphur \ndioxide  (SO	\n2),  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO	2),  and  particulate  matter  (PM	10)  have  been  identified  for \nregular  monitoring  at  all  the  locations.  Other  para meters  like  particulate  matter  (PM	\n2.5),  carbon \nmonoxide  (CO),  ammonia  (NH	\n3),  lead  (Pb),  ozone  (O	3),  benzene  (C	6H6),  benzo( ?)pyrene \n(B( ?)P),  arsenic  (As),  and  nickel  (Ni)  are  being  monito red  at  selected  locations  and  are  slowly \nbeing added to the monitoring networks under NAMP. 	\n5.  Source apportionment study  	\nTo  improve  the  air  quality  management  system,  there   is  also  the  need  of  knowing  the  particular \nsource  of  pollution  and  its  quantitative  contributi on  to  the  ambient  air  quality.  This  can  be  done \nthrough the  source apportionment study . There may be two ways for apportioning pollution,  (i) \nA  top-down  approach  starting  with  monitoring  of  pol lution,  and  (ii)  A  bottom-up  approach\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	7 	\nstarting  with  the  activity  data  (like  fuel  consumpt ion).  Source  apportionment  study  is  based  on \ntracking  down the sources through receptor  modeling  and it  helps in identifying the  sources and \nextent of their contribution.  	\n6.  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)  	\nTo build-up a programme for the effective  management of ambient  air quality  and to reduce the \ndamaging  effects  of  air  pollution,  development  of  n ational  ambient  air  quality  standards \n(NAAQS)  is  a  pre-requisite.  Central  Pollution  Contr ol  Board  had  adopted  first  ambient  air \nquality  standards  on  November  11,  1982  as  per  the  S ection  16(2)  of  the  Air  (Prevention  and \nControl of Pollution)  Act, 1981. These standards  ha ve  been revised by CPCB in 1994, and later \nin 2009, which is shown in Table 2.  \nTable 2: National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NA AQS) – 2009 [1] \nPollutants  Time  weighted \naverage  Concentration in ambient air  Methods of measurement\n 	\nIndustrial, \nresidential\n, rural, \nand other \nareas  Ecologically \nsensitive area \n(notified by  Central \nGovernment) 	\nSulphur  dioxide  \n(SO	\n2), µ g/m	3  Annual* \n24 hours**  50 \n80 20 \n80 -Improved West and Gaeke \n-Ultraviolet fluorescence  	\nNitrogen dioxide	 	\n(NO	2), µ g/m	3 Annual* \n24 hours**  40  \n80 30 \n80 -Modified  Jacob  & \nHochheiser (Na-Arsenite) \n-Chemiluminescence 	\nParticulate  \nmatter (< 10 µ m)  \nor PM	\n10, µ g/m	3 Annual* \n24 hours**  60 \n100  60 \n100  -Gravimetric  \n-TOEM  \n-Beta attenuation 	\nParticulate  \nmatter  (<  2.5  \nµ m)  or  PM	\n2.5, \nµ g/m	\n3  Annual* \n24 hours**  40  \n60 40 \n60 -Gravimetric \n-TOEM  \n-Beta attenuation 	\nOzone  (O	3),  8 hours**  100  100  -UV photometric\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	8 	\nµ g/m	3  1 hour**  180  180  -Chemiluminescence \n-Chemical method 	\nLead (Pb), µ g/m	3  Annual* 24 hours**  0.50 \n1.0  0.50 \n1.0  -AAS/ICP  method  after  \nsampling  on  EPM  2000  or  \nequivalent filter paper  \n-ED-XRF using Teflon filter 	\nCarbon  \nmonoxide  (CO),  \nmg/m	\n3  8 hours** \n1 hour**  02  \n04 02 \n04 -Non  Dispersive  Infra  Red \n(NDIR) spectroscopy 	\nAmmonia  (NH	3), \nµ g/m	\n3  Annual* \n24 hours**  100  \n400 100 \n400 -Chemiluminescence \n-Indophenol blue method 	\nBenzene  (C	6H6), \nµ g/m	\n3  Annual*  05  05  -Gas  chromatography  based \ncontinuous analyzer  \n-Adsorption  and  desorption  \nfollowed by GC analysis 	\nBenzo(?)Pyrene \n(BaP)  –  \nparticulate  phase \nonly, ng/m	\n3  Annual*  01  01  -Solvent  extraction  followed \nby HPLC/GC analysis 	\nArsenic  (As),  \nng/m	\n3 Annual*  06  06  -AAS/ICP  method  after \nsampling  on  EPM  2000  or  \nequivalent filter paper 	\nNickel  (Ni),  \nng/m	\n3 Annual*  20  20  -AAS/ICP  method  after \nsampling  on  EPM  2000  or  \nequivalent filter paper 	\n* Annual arithmetic mean of minimum 104 measurement s in a year at a particular site taken twice a week \n24 hourly at uniform intervals.  \n**  24  hourly  or  08  hourly  or  01  hourly  monitored  va lues,  as  applicable,  shall  be  compiled  with  98%  of \nthe  time  in  a  year.  2%  of  the  time,  they  may  exceed   the  limits  but  not  on  two  consecutive  days  of \nmonitoring.   \nNote  –  Whenever  and  wherever  monitoring  results  on  two  consecutive  days  of  monitoring  exceed  the \nlimits  specified  above  for  the  respective  category,   it  shall  be  considered  adequate  reason  to  institute \nregular or continuous monitoring and further invest igation.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	9 \n \n 	\nDelhi,  with an  area  of 1483 km	2 [2],  is  geographically located in North  India with in the latitude \n28°24’17”  and  28°53’00’’N,  and  longitude  77°45’30’’   and  77°21’30’’E  [3].  Delhi  is  jointly \nadministered by the Central and State Government. A s of 2011, Delhi inhabitates approximately \n16.3  million  people;  thus  becoming  the  second  most  populous  city  and  second  most  populous \nurban  agglomeration  in  India.  Delhi  is  also  the  thi rd  largest  urban  area  in  the  world.  However, \ndue  to  rapid  development,  Delhi  is  also  facing  seri ous  challenges  in  terms  of  air  pollution.  To \ntackle the situation, Delhi has taken several steps  to reduce the air pollution level during the last \n10 years. However, more concerted efforts are still  required to reduce the pollution level.  	\n7. Air quality monitoring in Delhi 	\nAir quality monitoring in Delhi is carried out thro ugh a number of air quality monitoring stations \nsituated  across  the  territory.  The  monitoring  is  un dertaken  by  various  organizations viz.  Central \nPollution  Control  Board  (CPCB),  Delhi  Pollution  Con trol  Committee  (DPCC),  and  System  of \nAir  Quality  and  Weather  Forecasting  and  Research  (S AFAR)  of  Indian  Institute  of  Tropical \nMeteorology  (IITM),  Pune.  As  per  the  NAMP  of  CPCB,  manual  air  pollution  monitoring  is \ncarried out  at Sarojini Nagar, Chandni Chowk,  Mayap uri  Industrial  Area, Pritampura,  Shahadra, \nShahzada  Bagh,  Nizamuddin,  Janakpuri,  Siri  Fort,  an d  at  ITO  as  traffic  intersection  station \nacross  the  Delhi.  Apart  from  the  manual  air  monitor ing  stations,  continuous  ambient  air  quality \nmonitoring (CAAQM) stations of CPCB are also locate d at 11 locations viz. Anand Vihar, Civil \nLines,  DCE,  Dilshad  Garden,  Dwarka,  IGI  Airport,  IT O,  Mandir  Marg,  Punjabi  Bagh,  R.K. \nPuram,  and  Shadipur  across  the  city  (Figure  1).  DPC C  has  air  quality  monitoring  stations  at  6 \nlocations  viz. Civil lines, Punjabi Bagh, Mandir Marg, Anand Viha r ISBT, IGI Airport, and R.K. \nPuram.  In  addition  to  CPCB  and  DPCC,  there  are  8  mo nitoring  stations  of  SAFAR  at  various \nlocations  in  Delhi,  as  shown  in  figure  1,  to  monito r  the  ambient  air  quality  on  real  time  basis. \nThe  data  obtained  from  these  stations  are  also  used   for  the  determination  of  national  air  quality \nindex.  	\nAir Pollution in Delhi: An Analysis\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	10	 	\n 	\nFigure 1. Air quality monitoring stations of various organiza tions in Delhi  \n 	\n8.  Air quality trends in Delhi 	\nAir  quality  for  the  three  major  pollutants  (SO	2,  NO	2,  and  PM)  is  determined  to  understand  the \ntrend  of  pollution  in  Delhi  during  recent  years.  On   the  basis  of  annual  average  concentration  of \npollutants,  air  quality  trend  has  been  seen  for  the   years  2009  –  2015  along  with  the  comparison \nwith  existing  national  ambient  air  quality  standard s  (NAAQS),  2009.  It  can  be  seen  in  figure  2 \nthat among the three pollutants  viz. SO	\n2, NO	2, and PM	10, the concentration of NO	2 and PM	10 are \nfar  exceeding  the  prescribed  standard  limits.  The  c oncentration  of  SO	\n2  is  within  the  standard \nlimits.  However,  as  far  as  NO	\n2  is  concerned,  continuous  rise  in  concentration  was   observed  in \npast  7  years.  Moreover,  the  problem  of  particulate  matter  (PM	\n10)  is  more  critical.  Since  2009, \napproximately  258  –  335%  rise  has  been  observed  in  PM	\n10  concentration  compared  to  the\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	11	 	\nstandards.  Although  the  concentration  has  been  slig htly  lowered  down  since  2011,  but  it  is  still \nfar above the safe limits. \n \nFigure 	2. Air quality trends in Delhi (2009 – 2015) based on manual air quality monitoring stations 	\n(Source:CPCB)	 \n  \nApart from the annual average data, continuous  air  monitoring data  of  Delhi is also recorded by \nCPCB at 11 locations, as stated above. Out of 11, t he data of 8 operating monitoring stations for \nthe period of December 1 – 10, 2015 is shown in fig ure 3. This graph reflects the average values \nof  the  SO	\n2,  NO	2,  and  PM	2.5  concentration  for  the  period  of  10  days.  Since,  th e  standards  for \nambient  air  quality  are  only  suitable  for  the  data  based  on  time  weighted  average  of  annual  and \n24 hours/8 hours/1 hour, the comparison of the data  of 10 days average with the standards is not \nfeasible. However, it is quite evident from the gra ph that concentration of NO	\n2 and PM	2.5 is very \nhigh.  Among  all  the  locations,  NO	\n2  and  PM	2.5  concentration  is  least  at  Dwarka.  The \nconcentration  of  particulate  matter  (PM	\n2.5)  at  all  the  other  locations  needs  to  be  curbed  dow n \nurgently  as  the  values  recorded  are  very  high.  More over,  the  concentration  of  SO	\n2  is  acceptable \nat all the locations across Delhi.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	12	 	\n 	\nFigure 	3. Air  quality  trends  in  Delhi  (Dec.  1  –  10,  2015)  bas ed  on  the  data  of  continuous  air \nquality monitoring stations (	\nSource:CPCB)  	\n  \n8.1 Air quality index (AQI) in Delhi  \nAir quality index (AQI) is the tool to monitor air  quality in major urban cities across the country \non  a  real  –  time  basis  and  to  enhance  public  awaren ess.  The  AQI  developed  is  based  on  human \nexposure  and  health  effects  and  may  not  be  strictly   applicable  to  ecologically  sensitive  areas. \nVarious  pollutants  which  are  considered  for  AQI  det ermination  are  PM	\n10,  PM	2.5,  NO	2,  O	3,  CO, \nSO	\n2, NH	3, and Pb. The data  obtained from the online air qua lity  monitoring stations is  the  most \nsuitable for the AQI determination  as information o n AQI can be generated in real time.  For the \nease of understanding, colour bands are used to rep resent various AQI bands.  \nAQI  Associated health impacts 	\nGood (0 – 50)  Minimal impact 	\nSatisfactory (51 – 100)  Minor breathing discomfort  to sensitive people \nModerately polluted 	\n(101 – 200) Breathing  discomfort  to  people  with  lungs,  asthma, \nand  heart \ndiseases 	\nPoor (201 – 300)  Breathing discomfort to most peopl e on prolonged exposure 	\nVery poor (301 – 400)  Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure \nSevere (401 – 500)  Affects  healthy  people,  and  seri ously  impacts  those  with  existing \ndiseases\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	13	 	\n..\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	14	 	\nAs  per  the  AQI  bulletin  (January  2016),  PM	2.5  is  the  prominent  pollutant  in  Delhi  and \nneighbouring  areas  which  continuously  exceeds  the  s tandard  [4].  In  the  months  of  May  – \nOctober,  the  AQI  shows  that  air  quality  is  moderate ly  polluted.  However,  after  October,  the \nsituation becomes worse. The average AQI in the mon th of January was recorded as very poor to \nsevere.  Maximum  value  of  PM	\n2.5  is  recorded  as  296  µ g/m	3  during  January  2016  (at  IHBAS, \nDilshad Garden) which is far above the prescribed s tandard limit (60 µ g/m	\n3). There are a number \nof sources responsible for the particulate matter s uch as transport, road dust, gaseous combustion \netc .  Moreover,  the  sources  /  natural  causes  also  get  i nfluenced  by  the  meteorological  conditions \nprevailing in the neighbouring areas. 	\n9.  Air quality assessment in Delhi 	\nFor  the  ease  of  understanding  the  pollution  level,  air  quality  can  be  categorised  into  four  broad \ncategories on the basis of exceedance factor (EF),  viz. the ratio of annual mean concentration of a \npollutant  and  its  respective  standard.  Accordingly,   the  air  pollution  can  be  categorized  into  4 \ntypes as: \n·  Critical pollution (C)     : EF  ? 1.5; \n·   High pollution (H)         : 1.0  ? EF < 1.5; \n·   Moderate pollution (M) : 0.5  ? EF < 1.0; and \n·   Low pollution (L)          : EF < 0.5 \nBased on the data of SO	\n2, NO	2, and PM	10, the exceedance factors are calculated which is sh own \nin figure 4. It is evident from the figure that pol lution level for SO	\n2 is low. The pollution level in \ncase of NO	\n2 is high along with critical in few of the years. M oreover, the pollution level crosses \ncritical  level  for  PM	\n10 	in  all  the  years.  This  indicates  that  immediate  att ention  is  needed  to  curb \nthe particulate matter.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	15	 	\n 	\nFigure 4.	 Pollution level based on exceedance factor (EF) of  SO	2, NO	2, and PM	10 in Delhi \n 	\n10.   Source apportionment study in Delhi  	\nThe study shows that the concentration of pollutant s is continuously on the rise, especially in the \ncase  of  particulate  matter,  where  pollution  level  i s  critical.  Therefore,  source  apportionment \nstudy  for  the  particulate  matter  has  been  undertake n  for  assessing  the  contribution  of  various \npollution sources for the PM	\n10 and PM	2.5. In case of Delhi, the survey has been conducted b y IIT \nKanpur in coordination with Government of NCT of De lhi during winter and summer seasons at \nsix  characteristic  locations  –  Dwarka  (residential) ,  Rohini  (residential  and  industrial),  Okhla \n(industrial),  Vasantkunj  (residential-cum-commercia l),  Dilshad  garden  (industrial),  and  Pusa \nroad  (residential-cum-commercial),  for  assessing  th e  contribution  of  various  pollution  sources \nfor the PM	\n10 and PM	2.5. The idea of sampling in winter and summer months  is influenced by the \nfact  that  winter  conditions  provide  low  dispersion  and  high  concentrations  of  pollutants  while \nduring    the  summer  months,  meteorology  gets  improve d  leading  to  better  dispersion  conditions \nfor pollutants. Based on the study, following infor mation can be summarized: \nPM	\n10:  At  all  the  locations,  the  major  sources  for  PM	10  during  winter  months  are  biomass \nburning,  vehicular  emission,  soil  and  road  dust,  co al  and  flyash,  secondary  particles etc.  in\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	16	 	\ndifferent proportions.  Secondary  particles originat e from precursor  gases  such as, SO	2  and NO	2. \nVehicles  and  power  plants  are  largely  responsible  f or  NO	\n2  emission,  while  SO	2  emission  is \nmainly  attributed  by  large  power  plants  and  refiner ies  situated  in  the  upwind  direction  of  Delhi. \nApart from this, construction materials are also re sponsible for PM	\n10.    \nDuring  summer  months,  soil  and  road  dust,  coal  and  flyash,  secondary  particles,  solid  waste \nburning, and vehicular emissions are largely respon sible for PM	\n10, along with minor contribution \nfrom construction activities. Role of industrial po llution in the overall concentration of PM	\n10 is < \n1% at all the locations.  \nPM	\n2.5:  For  the  PM	2.5,  secondary  particles,  vehicular  emissions,  biomass   burning,  soil  and  road \ndust,  and  solid  waste  burning  are  largely  responsib le  in  winter  months.  Moreover,  coal  and \nflyash, soil and road dust, secondary particles are   the major factors responsible for PM	\n2.5 during \nsummer  months  along  with  the  other  sources.  Industr ial  pollution  contributes  to  <1  –  2%  at  all \nthe locations.  Large amount of flyash and dust duri ng summer  months may  be due to high wind \nspeed  and  high  temperature  leading  to  extremely  dry   conditions  which  make  dust  airborne. \nFurther, dust storms may also result in the re-susp ension of flyash and road/soil dust.  	\n11.  Conclusion  	\nBased  on  the  above  observations,  it  can  be  said  tha t  the  air  of  Delhi  is  polluted esp.  in  terms  of \nparticulates.  According  to  a  study,  vehicular  pollu tion  alone  contributes  about  72%  of  the  total \nair  pollution  load  in  Delhi  as  estimated  using  emis sion  factor  and  activity-based  approach \nrecommended  by  IPCC  [5].  However,  present  study  fin ds  that  it  is  not  only  the  vehicular \npollution,  rather,  domestic  pollution,  industrial  e mission,  road  dust,  and  garbage  burning  also \nhave  a  large  share  in  Delhi’s  total  pollution  load.   Furthermore,  construction  of  infrastructure \nincluding large residential complexes potentially c ontributes to the Delhi’s air pollution load.  \nStudy also finds that the concentration of SO	\n2 is well under control. This is due to phasing out  of \ndiesel  driven  buses,  reduction  of  sulphur  content  i n  diesel  by  about  90%,  and  implication  of \nBharat  Stage  IV  norms  in  vehicles  of  Delhi.  The  maj or  cause  of  rising  NO	\n2  concentration  in \nDelhi is increased traffic load.  In atmosphere, the  combination of nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O	\n3), \nand  hydrocarbons  leads  to  the  formation  of  NO	\n2.  Therefore  to  minimize  the  NO	2  pollution,  all\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	17	 	\nthe three components involved in its formation need s to be targeted. To substantiate the findings, \ntrend  of increasing  vehicular usage is shown  in  fig ure 5.  Since 2005  – 06  to 2014 – 15,  82.75% \nincrease  can  be  noted  in  the  number  of  registered  v ehicles  in  Delhi.  Moreover,  the  excessive \nusage  of  cars  and  motor  cycles  are  the  pertinent  ca uses  for  rising  vehicular  pollution  load.  This \ncorroborates  the  cause  of  increasing  NO	\n2  as  well  as  particulate  matter  concentration.  Parti culate \nmatter  (PM	\n10  and  PM	2.5)  emanates  especially  from  the  vehicular  exhausts;  particularly  diesel \nvehicles, road dust, and industrial activities such  as combustion processes, construction activities \netc .  	\n 	 	\nFigure 5.  Traffic load in Delhi 	\n(Source:Economic survey of Delhi 2014 – 15)    	\nTremendous  growth  of  industrial  sector  is  also  resp onsible  for  pollution.  As  per  the  report  of \nEconomic  Survey  of  Delhi  2014-15  [6],  there  are  8.9 3  lakhs  total  industrial  establishments \noperating  in  Delhi  according  to  6	\nth  Economic  Census  2013,  which  is  18.35%  more  than  th e \nnumber  of  establishments  according  to  5	\nth  Economic  Census  2005.  In  many  of  the  industries, \ninstalled  air  pollution  control  devices  are  found  i n  idle  conditions  which  lead  to  the  emission  of \npollutants  directly  into  the  atmosphere  without  any   filtration.  Further,  construction  of  short \nchimneys also restricts the polluting gases to esca pe into the upper layers of the atmosphere. \nTraffic congestion on the roads, although underesti mated, is another very important factor as far \nas  air  pollution  is  concerned.  As  it  is  evident  fro m  figure  5,  cars  and  jeeps  are  responsible  for  a \nmajor  share  of  Delhi’s  vehicular  load,  their  conges tion  on  the  roads  create  nuisance.  Moreover, \n4-wheelers  also  need  a  lot  of  space  for  parking.  Th is  further  reduces  the  space  on  the  roads\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	18	 	\nleading  to  high  frequency  of  traffic  jams.  To  reduc e  the  pollution  at  traffic  intersection  points, \ntime  clocks  have  been  installed  at  most  of  the  poin ts  in  the  city.  But  it  has  been  observed  that \nhardly  any  vehicle  owner  switches  off  the  engine  du ring  that  period.  Thus  fuel  is  continuously \nburned at a fixed place which further adds up in th e atmospheric pollution load. \nMeteorological issues  \nApart from the vehicular and industrial emissions,  local climatic and seasonal factors also affect \nthe air quality of Delhi. Delhi, being a land-locke d territory, is unable to dilute its emission using \nthe  moderating  effects  of  sea;  the  opportunity  avai led  by  other  metropolitan  cities,  such  as \nMumbai,  Kolkata,  and  Chennai.  Surrounded  by  the  reg ions  of  varied  climate,  Delhi  also \nrepresents  a  great  variability  in  the  seasonal  patt erns.  At  its  west,  there  is  Great  Indian  desert \n(Thar desert) of Rajasthan while in the north and e ast direction there are cool hilly regions. At its \nsouth,  there  are  central  hot  plains.  Thus,  Delhi  is   located  in  the  subtropical  belt  with  extremely \nscorching summers, moderate rainfall, and chilling  winters.  \nThe  winters  are  extremely  important  in  Delhi  as  it  is  dominated  by  cold,  dry  air,  and  ground \nbased inversion with low wind conditions, which are  responsible for increasing concentration of \npollutants  [7,  8].  High  concentration  of  pollutants   is  trapped  close  to  earth’s  surface  bacause  a \nlayer  of  warm  air  acts  as  a  lid  on  top  of  this  laye r.  Moreover,  dense  smog  formation  during \nwinter  months  has  also  been  witnessed  in  Delhi,  the   reason  of  which  is  vehicular  pollution  as \nwell  as  the  prevailing  meteorological  conditions  in   the  months  of  December  and  January. \nSimilarly,  wind  pattern  also  affects  the  weather  co nditions.  According  to  a  study,  during  the \nautumn  and  winter  months,  approximately  500  million   tons  of  crop  residues  are  burnt  in  Indo-\nGangetic plains [9]. The image in figure 6 (a) show s the biomass burning in the state of Punjab. \nThe  wind  blows  from  India’s  north  and  north-west  to   the  east  direction  during  winters  as \ndepicted  from  the  wind-rose  diagram  of  Delhi  (Figur e  6  b).  This  ultimately  results  in \ncombination of pollution and fog, leading to heavy  smog formation in Delhi esp. during winters. \nIn  summers,  although  there  is  no  inversion  phenomen on,  still  the  air  quality  gets  deteriorated \nbecause of the increased concentration of PM	\n10, which is due to dust. However, it becomes toxic \ndue to the coating of polluted emissions from vario us sources. Nevertheless, during rainy season \npollution level goes down due to dust suspension. T hus, air pollution in Delhi is a trans-boundary \nand climate induced phenomenon.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	19	 	\n 	\n(a)	 Image showing the biomass burning in Punjab (red do ts show the fires and plume) 	\nSource: NASA	 \n \n(b)	\n Wind-rose diagram of Delhi  	\nSource: Indian Meteorological Department, Ministry  of Earth Sciences	 \nFigure 6.

Measures adopted to improve the air quality of Delh i	 	\n12.1 Recent initiatives \n12.1.1. Odd even scheme  \nAn initiative (on trial basis) has been taken by Go vt. of NCT of Delhi to curb the air pollution by \napplying ‘Odd-even scheme’ on the 4-wheelers plying  on the roads (exempting a few) from Jan. \n1	\nst  –  15	th  and  Apr.  15	th  –  30	th, 2016.  The  scheme  proposed  to  run  the  vehicles  as  pe r  their \nregistration  numbers  on  alternate  days.  Vehicles  ha ving  registration  number  ending  with  an  odd \ndigit were allowed to run on the odd dates and  vice-versa. The ultimate aim of the scheme was to \nreduce the number of vehicles from the roads of Del hi. \nTo  assess  the  effect  of  this  scheme  on  the  air  qual ity  of  Delhi,  an  analysis  was  done  using  the \ndata  collected  by  CPCB  from  8  operational  CAAQMS  (4   of  CPCB  and  4  of  DPCC)  and  7 \nmanual  stations  of  CPCB  [10].  The  pollutants  studie d  include  PM	\n10,  PM	2.5,  SO	2,  benzene,  O	3, \nNO	\n2,  and  CO.  The  study  reveals  that  during  the  odd-eve n  period,  there  was  marked  increase  in \nthe pollutants concentration as compared to ‘pre –  odd even period’, for e.g. there can be seen 13 \n–  39%  rise  in  PM	\n10  concentration,  52  –  70%  rise  in  PM	2.5,  and  37  –  80%  rise  in  NO	2 \nconcentration  [10].  Other  pollutants  were  also  foun d  to  be  increasing.  No  definite  reason  could \nbe  determined  for  this,  however,  unclear  trend  and  wide  fluctuations  of  air  pollutants  can  be \nattributed  to  the  meteorological  factors  and  emissi ons  from  pollution  sources  other  than \ntransportation.  Moreover,  the  odd-even  scheme  effec t  might  also  be  diluted  due  to  coverage  of \nvery few vehicles under this scheme.	\n 	\n12.1.2.  Court directions \nA  number  of  directions  under  Section  18(1)(b)  of  th e  Air  (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution) \nAct,  1981  regarding  prevention,  control  or  abatemen t  of  air  pollution  and  improvement  of \nambient  air  quality  in  Delhi  and  National  Capital  R egion  (NCR)  were  issued  to  U.P.  Pollution \nControl  Board,  Haryana  Pollution  Control  Board,  Del hi  Pollution  Control  Committee,  and \nJhalana  Institutional  Area, Jaipur, Rajasthan  on De c. 29	\nth, 2015. The directions included various \nsignificant  issues  such  as  control  of  vehicular  emi ssion,  control  of  road  dust  and  other  fugitive\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	21	 	\nemission,  control  of  air  pollution  from  biomass  bur ning,  control  of  industrial  air  pollution, \ncontrol of air pollution from construction and demo lition activities, etc. \n12.1.3.  A control room has been set up in CPCB to facilitat e review of levels of air pollution and \nmonitoring ambient air quality in Delhi and Nationa l Capital Region (NCR). \n12.1.4.  Prohibition  on  entry  of  overloaded  and  non-destined   trucks  in  Delhi  and  imposition  of \n‘Green Tax’. \n12.1.5.  The  Delhi  Government  has  launched  car-free  day  camp aign  ‘Ab  Bus  Karein ’  since  22	\nnd \nOctober 2015 to be observed on 22	\nnd day of every month. \n12.1.6.  Air Quality Index (AQI) \nTo  reduce  the  health  impacts  of  the  pollutants,  dis semination  of  the  information  related  to  air \nquality is also equally important so that the preve ntive measures can be adopted. In view of this, \nCPCB and the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and C limate Change (MoEF & CC) initiated the \nproject  on  national  Air  Quality  Index  (AQI)  to  stre ngthen  air  quality  information  dissemination \nsystem  for  larger  public  awareness  and  their  partic ipation  on  air  quality  management  [11].  The \nindex was launched by  Hon’ble Prime Minister in Apr il 2015 starting with 14 cities. At present, \nAQI is determined at 23 locations across the countr y, including Delhi, Faridabad, and Gurgaon. \n12.1.7.  For  the on-line continuous  (24x7) air pollution mon itoring, out of 2800 major industries, \n920 industries have installed the devices; and othe rs are in process of installation. \n \n12.2.  Other initiatives \n12.2.1.

Recommendations/suggestions to improve the air qua lity of Delhi 	\nEven  after  taking  a  number  of  initiatives,  the  pollution  in  Delhi  is  rising  to  a  great  extent.  To \ntackle  the  problems  and  to  reduce  health  risks  gene rated  due  to  air  pollution,  immediate  steps \nneed to be taken. Therefore, following issues need  to be judiciously addressed at the earliest.  \n1.  For  the  development  of  the  country,  establishment  o f  new  industrial  units  can  not  be \ndowngraded; however,  effective  control  measures of  pollution, and  proper installation of \nair  pollution  control  devices  and  their  smooth  func tioning  must  be  ensured  before  the \nestablishment  of  any  industry.  After  the  establishm ent  of  industry,  proper  functioning  of \nthe installed controlling units must also be ensure d. \n2.  Emission  from  construction  industries  /  activities  can  be  minimized  by  adopting  best \npractices  such  as;  use  of  water  sprays  for  dust  sup pression,  creating  ridges  to  prevent \ndust,  compaction  of  disturbed  soil,  prevention  of  d umping  of  earth  materials  along  road \nside  etc. \n3.  Restrictions  may  be  imposed  over  the  number  of  vehi cles  owned  by  an/a \nindividual/family.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	23	 	\n4. Fines should be imposed for the parking of vehicles  on the roads. \n5.  Provision  of  parking  space  in  any  commercial  establ ishment/shopping \nmall/parks/residential apartments should be mandato ry. \n6.  There  should  be  strict  restrictions  on  old  pollutin g  vehicles  and  subsidies  may  be  given \non the vehicles running on cleaner fuels. \n7.  There should be strict checking of PUC certificates . \n8.  There should be uniformity in the fuel quality stan dards used across the country. \n9.  There should be more space for pedestrians and two  wheeler vehicles on the roads. \n10.  Up-gradation of public transport is necessary by im proving service quality, enhancing the \nnumber of buses, and better road management. \n11.  Improvement  in  traffic  signal  co-ordination  for  con tinuous  traffic  flow  to  reduce  traffic \njam and idling time can also help to minimize pollu tion. \n12.  Corporate firms/ government offices may draw up an  action plan to have bus/cab service \nfor their employees with reasonable rates. \n13.  Idea  of  working  in  different  shifts  for  corporate  f irms  /  government  offices  to  minimize \ntraffic at peak hours can be introduced.  \n14.  Strict  rules  should  be  imposed  for  proper  dumping  a nd  disposal  of  solid  waste,  since \nunregulated  burning  results  in  pile-up  of  smoke  and   particulate  matter  in  concentrated \nform  at one  place.  Regular functioning of all the i nstalled solid waste treatment facilities \nmust also be ensured.  \n15.  Vegetation cover should be increased along the high ways, road dividers, and busy traffic \nintersection points.  \n16.  Mass awareness should be increased through electron ic and print media for all age groups \ntowards  sustaining  the  environment  and  to  reduce  po llution.  Public  should  also  be \nmotivated for the use of public transport. \n17.  Research and development for the battery-run buses/ cars etc. needs to be promoted.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	24	 	\nReferences: 	\n1.

Which is the greatest modern aircraft carrier and why? Our Top 10 analysis is based on the combined score of size, displacement, airwing, offensive and defensive weapons and other features.\n   This list also includes aircraft carriers, that are currently under construction, but will enter service within the next couple of years.\n   Currently top 10 deadliest aircraft carriers in the world are these:\n  Nr.1 Ford class (USA)\n    Displacement: 100 000 t\nLength: 335 m\n85 aircraft\n   The Ford class is a successor to the Nimitz class. These are the largest and most powerful warships ever built. First aircraft carrier of the class is expected to be commissioned with the US Navy in 2017. It is expected that a total of 9-10 new Ford class aircraft carriers will be built. These will replace the Nimitz and Improved Nimitz class warships. The Ford class aircraft carriers will be the mainstay of the US Navy\'s power projection throughout the 21st century.\n   Hull design of the Ford class is similar to that of the Nimitz class. The new aircraft carriers have a smaller, redesigned and more stealthy island. The new aircraft carriers have the same displacement as the previous Nimitz class, but are fitted with more automated and efficient systems.\n   Each of these vessels will carry an airwing that will include 85 fixed-wing aircraft, VSTOL aircraft, helicopters, or unmanned aerial vehicles. These will include F-35B/C and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet multi-role fighters, EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft, E-2D Advanced Hawkeye early warning aircraft, MH-60R and MH-60S naval helicopters. It is larger and more powerful force than complete air force of many nations. By operating these aircraft carriers United States will remain unchallenged sea force on earth throughout the 21st century.\n   Defensive weapons of the Ford class include two launchers with 16 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM) each. These missiles are used against incoming high-speed, maneuveing anti-ship missiles. It also has two launchers with 21 Rolling Airframe Missiles (RAM) that are also used against anti-ship missiles at close range. Also there are four 20 mm Phalanx close-in weapon systems.\n    Nr.2 Improved Nimitz class (USA)\n    Displacement: 100 000 t\nLength: 332 m\n80 aircraft\n   A total of 10 of these supercarriers were built, including 3 Nimitz class ships and 7 Improved Nimitz class ships. These have been the largest warships built and in service.\n   These nuclear-powered aircraft carriers can carry about 80 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. These ships operate F/A-18E/F Super Hornets multi-role fighters, F/A-18C Hornets ground attack aircraft, EA-6B Prowlers electronic warfare aircraft, E-2C Hawkeye early warning aircraft, C-2 Greyhound transport aircraft and various helicopters for utility, transport and anti-submarine warfare operations.\n   These supercarriers typically operate over 60 aircraft and helicopters. However surge capacity is 130 F/A-18 Hornets.\n   These supercarriers have automated self-defence systems against anti-ship cruise missiles by integrating and co-coordinating the ship\'s weapon and electronic warfare systems.\n   In the forthcomming decades all of these vessels are due to be replaced by the new Ford class aircraft carriers.\n    Nr.3 Kuznetsov (Russia)\n    Displacement: 60 000 t\nLength: 305 m\n40 aircraft\n   The Admiral Kuznetsov was commissioned with the Russian Navy in 1991. It is smaller than American supercarriers, but carries powerful offensive weapons.\n   The lack of catapults precludes launching aircraft with heavy strike loads, and the air superiority orientation of the air wing is apparent. This warship carries about 40 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters, including Su-33 carrier-based air superiority fighters and various versions of Ka-27 helicopter. There is also a twin-seat Su-25UTG aircraft used for pilot training.\n   The Admiral Kuznetsov is a heavy aviation cruiser rather than just an aircraft carrier. It carries a number of offensive weapons typically associated with guided missile cruisers. The carrier itself is capable of engaging surface, subsurface and airborne targets.\n   This ship is conventionally propelled with oil-fired boilers rather than nuclear reactor.\n   Service of the Admiral Kuznetsov in the Russian Navy is plagued with various accidents and plane crashes. There are problems with the ship\'s propulsion system. Russia definitely struggles maintaining its only aircraft carrier and keeping it operational. There are no immediate plans in Russia to construct successor for this ship.\n   Since 2018 this Russian aircraft carrier is being repaired, refurbished and upgraded in order to extend its service life. It is expected to return to service in 2021.\n   Unfinished hull of the second ship of the class was acquired by the Chinese navy. It was refitted with modern outfit and commissioned in service with the Chinese navy in 2012 as the Liaoning.\n    Nr.4 Liaoning (China)\n    Displacement: 60 000 t\nLength: 305 m\n40 aircraft\n   The Varyag was a second ship of the Kuznetsov class. It was laid down in 1985 in Ukraine and launched in 1988. However after collapse of the Soviet Union funding for the ship construction stopped. Eventually unfinished hull was sold to China where it was restored and refitted. This aircraft carrier was commissioned with the China\'s navy in 2012 as the Liaoning. It was one of the most ambitions Chinese naval programmes.\n   The Liaoning can carry up to 50 fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. It operates a mixed of Chinese J-15 air superiority fighters, Z-8 helicopters and Russian Ka-31 airborne early warning helicopters.\n   After refit the Chinese ship lost all offensive heavy armament of the Kuznetsov class. Now it carries only short-range defensive weapons. Despite that the Liaoning represent a significant shift in the balance of naval power in the area.\n   In 2017 another aircraft carrier of this class was launched in China. It was built to improved Type 001A project. There have been speculations that this warship will be named the Shandong. It is the first aircraft carrier ever manufactured in China. It should become operational in 2019-2020.\n    Nr.5 Queen Elizabeth class (United Kingdom)\n    Displacement: 65 000 t\nLength: 284 m\n40 aircraft\n   Two Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers were ordered by the Royal Navy. The first of the class, HMS Queen Elizabeth, was laid down in 2009. It became operational in 2017.\n   The sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales was laid down in 2011 and launched in 2017. It is planned to be commissioned with the Royal Navy in 2020. These new aircraft carriers are the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.\n   The Queen Elizabeth class carriers are be much more capable comparing with the previous Invincible class light aircraft carriers. These can carry over 40 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.\n   The Queen Elizabeth class carriers have broadly similar dimensions and displacement to the Russian Admiral Kuznetsov and Chinese Liaoning. The Russian and Chinese carriers operate air superiority fighters, while the Queen Elizabeth class ships will carry lighter but stealthy F-35B stealthy multi-role fighters with STOVL capability. These fighters will perform air defense, ground attack and reconnaissance missions. Also there is a mix of CH-47 Chinook, Merlin and AW159 (previously knonwn as Lynx Wildcat) helicopters for utility and anti-submarine warfare roles.\n   Defensive weapons are limited to Phalanx close-in weapon systems to counter airborne threats and 30 mm naval guns to counter seaborne threats.\n    Nr.6 Charles de Gaulle (France)\n    Displacement: 41 000 t\nLength: 262 m\n40 aircraft\n   It is a relatively modern nuclear-powered warship. It was commissioned with the French Navy in 2001. Currently it is the flagship of the French Navy. It is the only nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, built outside United States.\n   The Charled de Gaulle can carry over 40 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. It can operate over 30 navalized Rafale multi-role fighters. Also there are E-2C Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft as well as SA 365F Dauphin or AS 322 Cougar helicopters.\n   Second ship of the class was planned but never ordered due to lack of funding.\n    Nr.7 Vikramaditya (India)\n    Displacement: 45 000 t\nLength: 273 m\n30 aircraft\n   The Indian Navy Vikramaditya light aircraft carrier is a modified and refitted former Kiev class aviation cruiser. For the Russia Navy it was too expensive to operate these aviation cruisers on a post-Cold War budget. Eventually one of the Ships was sold to India.\n   In 2004 an agreement was signed with Russia for the sale of this ship to India. It was commissioned to service with the Indian Navy in 2014. It will replace the ageing Viraat aircraft carrier.\n   The INS Vikramaditya can operate about 30 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters including MiG-29KU and MiG-29KUB carrier-based multi-role fighters, Sea Harrier  STOVL ground attack aircraft, HAL Dhruv utility helicopters helicopters and Ka-31 airborne early warning helicopters. Maximum capacity is 30 aircraft and 6 helicopters.\n   The INS Vikramaditya lost some offensive heavy weapons of the Admiral Gorshkov, carried at the bow. Currently it is armed only with short-range air defense weapons.\n    Nr.8 Sao Paulo (Brazil)\n    Displacement: 34 000 t\nLength: 265 m\n40 aircraft\n   The Sao Paulo is a Clemenceau class aircraft carrier. It was originally commissioned with the French Navy in 1963 as the Foch. The ship was sold to Brazil in 2000 where it became the new flagship of Brazilian Navy.\n   The Sao Paulo can carry a mix of up to 40 aircraft and helicopters. However this aircraft carrier currently serves mainly for pilots training. Its offensive capability is limited.\n   Airwing of this aircraft carrier is rather weak. Its main interceptor and attack aircraft is the A-4KU Skyhawk. These aircraft carry AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles and free-fall bombs. These ageing aircraft have only a limited anti-shipping and ground attack capability and can not match modern air superiority fighters and ground attack aircraft.\n    Nr.9 Cavour (Italy)\n    Displacement: 27 000 t\nLength: 244 m\n20 aircraft\n   The Cavour light aircraft carrier was commissioned in 2008. Currently it is a new flagship of the Italian Navy.\n   This modern warship was designed to operate V/STOL aircraft, helicopters and serve as a command center. The Cavour can also transport military personnel and vehicles.\n   The Cavour can carry over 20 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Currently it operates Boeing V-8B Harrier II Plus ground attack aircraft. In the near future these will be replaced by the new Lockheed Martin F-35Bs.\n   For utility, anti-submarine warfare and airborne surveillance roles this light aircraft carrier operates EH-101, NH-90 and SH-3D helicopters.\n   This light aircraft carrier has amphibious assault capability. It can transport main battle tanks and amphibious assault vehicles in its aircraft hangar. Also it accommodates a regiment of 325 marines.\n    Nr.10 Chakri Naruebet (Thailand)\n    Displacement: 11 500 t\nLength: 182 m\n30 aircraft\n   The Chakri Narue light aircraft carrier was built in Spain. It was commissioned with the Royal Thai Navy in 1997. It is the first aircraft carrier to be operated by a country in Southeast Asia.\n   It has an airwing of about 30 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. These include AV-8S Matador ground attack aircraft and S-70B Seahawk, Sea King or CH-47 Chinook helicopters for anti-submarine wearfare, utility and transport missions.\n   However the Chakri Naruebet lacks defensive weapons. The planned primary anti-aircraft armament including an 8-cell VLS launcher for Sea Sparrow missiles and four Vulcan Phalanx CIWS mountings have not been installed. This vessel is protected just by Mistral short-range infra-red homing missiles.\n   The Chakri Naruebet makes few operational sorties, and when it does put to sea it is usually to carry members of the Thai Royal family. The vessel is therefore to be regarded less as a V/STOL amphibious warfare capable carrier and more as the most expensive royal yacht afloat.\n \nTop 10 Attack Submarines\n\nTop 10 Amphibious Assault Ships\n\nTop 10 Frigates\nCan\'t find what you\'re looking for? \n                      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Home     Aircraft     Helicopters     Tanks     Armored Vehicles     Artillery     Trucks     Engineering Vehicles     Missiles     Naval Forces     Firearms     AutoPartsPRO.co.uk     |     Contact Us\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n© ARG 2006 - 2019\nwww.Military-Today.com Top 10 Aircraft Carriers', '2019-03-22 12:09:06'),

Convert this document to a modern ebook format, such as AZW3 for Kindles or EPUB for other ebook readers, to see it in action.\r\nThere is support for images, tables, lists, footnotes, endnotes, links, dropcaps and various types of text and paragraph level formatting.\r\nTo see the DOCX conversion in action, simply add this file to calibre using the “Add Books” button and then click “Convert”.  Set the output format in the top right corner of the conversion dialog to EPUB or AZW3 and click “OK”.\r\nText FormattingInline formattingHere, we demonstrate various types of inline text formatting and the use of embedded fonts.\r\nHere is some bold, italic, bold-italic, underlined and struck out  text. Then, we have a superscript and a subscript. Now we see some red, green and blue text. Some text with a yellow highlight. Some text in a box. Some text in inverse video.\r\nA paragraph with styled text: subtle emphasis  followed by strong text and intense emphasis. This paragraph uses document wide styles for styling rather than inline text properties as demonstrated in the previous paragraph — calibre can handle both with equal ease.\r\nFun with fontsThis document has embedded the Ubuntu font family. The body text is in the Ubuntu typeface, here is some text in the Ubuntu Mono typeface, notice how every letter has the same width, even i and m. Every embedded font will automatically be embedded in the output ebook during conversion. \r\nParagraph level formattingYou can do crazy things with paragraphs, if the urge strikes you. For instance this paragraph is right aligned and has a right border. It has also been given a light gray background.\r\nFor the lovers of poetry amongst you, paragraphs with hanging indents, like this often come in handy. You can use hanging indents to ensure that a line of poetry retains its individual identity as a line even when the screen is  too narrow to display it as a single line. Not only does this paragraph have a hanging indent, it is also has an extra top margin, setting it apart from the preceding paragraph.\r\nTablesITEM NEEDED\r\nBooks 1\r\nPens 3\r\nPencils 2\r\nHighlighter 2 colors\r\nScissors 1 pair\r\nTables in Word can vary from the extremely simple to the extremely complex. calibre tries to do its best when converting tables. While you may run into trouble with the occasional table, the vast majority of common cases should be converted very well, as demonstrated in this section. Note that for optimum results, when creating tables in Word, you should set their widths using percentages, rather than absolute units.  To the left of this paragraph is a floating two column table with a nice green border and header row.\r\nNow let’s look at a fancier table—one with alternating row colors and partial borders. This table is stretched out to take 100% of the available width.\r\nCity or Town Point A Point B Point C Point D Point E\r\nPoint A — Point B 87 — Point C 64 56 — Point D 37 32 91 — Point E 93 35 54 43 —\r\nNext, we see a table with special formatting in various locations. Notice how the formatting for the header row and sub header rows is preserved.\r\nCollege New students Graduating students Change\r\nUndergraduate Cedar University 110 103 +7\r\nOak Institute 202 210 -8\r\nGraduate Cedar University 24 20 +4\r\nElm College 43 53 -10\r\nTotal 998 908 90\r\nSource: Fictitious data, for illustration purposes only\r\nNext, we have something a little more complex, a nested table, i.e. a table inside another table. Additionally, the inner table has some of its cells merged. The table is displayed horizontally centered.\r\nOne\r\nThree Two\r\nFour\r\nTo the left is a table inside a table, with some cells merged.\r\nWe end with a fancy calendar, note how much of the original formatting is preserved. Note that this table will only display correctly on relatively wide screens. In general, very wide tables or tables whose cells have fixed width requirements don’t fare well in ebooks.\r\nDecember 2007\r\nSun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat\r\n1\r\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8\r\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\n16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n23 24 25 26 27 28 29\r\n30 31 Structural ElementsMiscellaneous structural elements you can add to your document, like footnotes, endnotes, dropcaps and the like. \r\nFootnotes &amp; EndnotesFootnotes and endnotes are automatically recognized and both are converted to endnotes, with backlinks for maximum ease of use in ebook devices.\r\nDropcapsD\r\nrop caps are used to emphasize the leading paragraph at the start of a section. In Word it is possible to specify how many lines of text a drop-cap should use. Because of limitations in ebook technology, this is not possible when converting.  Instead, the converted drop cap will use font size and line height to simulate the effect as well as possible. While not as good as the original, the result is usually tolerable. This paragraph has a “D” dropcap set to occupy three lines of text with a font size of 58.5 pts. Depending on the screen width and capabilities of the device you view the book on, this dropcap can look anything from perfect to ugly.\r\nLinksTwo kinds of links are possible, those that refer to an external website and those that refer to locations inside the document itself. Both are supported by calibre. For example, here is a link pointing to the calibre download page. Then we have a link that points back to the section on paragraph level formatting in this document.\r\nTable of ContentsThere are two approaches that calibre takes when generating a Table of Contents. The first is if the Word document has a Table of Contents itself. Provided that the Table of Contents uses hyperlinks, calibre will automatically use it. The levels of the Table of Contents are identified by their left indent, so if you want the ebook to have a multi-level Table of Contents, make sure you create a properly indented Table of Contents in Word.\r\nIf no Table of Contents is found in the document, then a table of contents is automatically generated from the headings in the document. A heading is identified as something that has the Heading 1 or Heading 2, etc. style applied to it. These headings are turned into a Table of Contents with Heading 1 being the topmost level, Heading 2 the second level and so on.\r\n You can see the Table of Contents created by calibre by clicking the Table of Contents button in whatever viewer you are using to view the converted ebook. \r\n TOC \\o \"1-3\" \\h \\z \\u Demonstration of DOCX support in calibre PAGEREF _Toc359077851 \\h 1Text Formatting PAGEREF _Toc359077852 \\h 2Inline formatting PAGEREF _Toc359077853 \\h 2Fun with fonts PAGEREF _Toc359077854 \\h 2Paragraph level formatting PAGEREF _Toc359077855 \\h 2Tables PAGEREF _Toc359077856 \\h 3Structural Elements PAGEREF _Toc359077857 \\h 5Footnotes &amp; Endnotes PAGEREF _Toc359077858 \\h 5Dropcaps PAGEREF _Toc359077859 \\h 5Links PAGEREF _Toc359077860 \\h 5Table of Contents PAGEREF _Toc359077861 \\h 5Images PAGEREF _Toc359077862 \\h 7Lists PAGEREF _Toc359077863 \\h 8Bulleted List PAGEREF _Toc359077864 \\h 8Numbered List PAGEREF _Toc359077865 \\h 8Multi-level Lists PAGEREF _Toc359077866 \\h 8Continued Lists PAGEREF _Toc359077867 \\h 8\r\nImagesImages can be of three main types. Inline images are images that are part of the normal text flow, like this image of a green dot . Inline images do not cause breaks in the text and are usually small in size.lefttop The next category of image is a floating image, one that “floats “ on the page and is surrounded by text. Word supports more types of floating images than are possible with current ebook technology, so the conversion maps floating images to simple left and right floats, as you can see with the left and right arrow images on the sides of this paragraph.\r\nThe final type of image is a “block” image, one that becomes a paragraph on its own and has no text on either side. Below is a centered green dot.\r\ncenter6985righttopCentered images like this are useful for large pictures that should be a focus of attention. \r\nGenerally, it is not possible to translate the exact positioning of images from a Word document to an ebook. That is because in Word, image positioning is specified in absolute units from the page boundaries.  There is no analogous technology in ebooks, so the conversion will usually end up placing the image either centered or floating close to the point in the text where it was inserted, not necessarily where it appears on the page in Word.\r\nListsAll types of lists are supported by the conversion, with the exception of lists that use fancy bullets, these get converted to regular bullets.\r\nBulleted ListOne\r\nTwo\r\nNumbered ListOne, with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly\r\nTwo\r\nMulti-level ListsOne\r\nTwo\r\nThree\r\nFour with a very long line to demonstrate that the hanging indent for the list is working correctly.\r\nFive\r\nSix\r\nA Multi-level list with bullets:\r\nOne\r\nTwo\r\nThis bullet uses an image as the bullet item\r\nFour\r\nFive\r\nContinued ListsOne\r\nTwo\r\nAn interruption in our regularly scheduled listing, for this essential and very relevant public service announcement.\r\nWe now resume our normal programming\r\nFour\r\n', 'http://localhost/sokrets/uploads/files/demo.docx', '2019-03-08 11:46:03', 0),

Introduction \nPure air is a mixture of various gases such as nitr ogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and small \namount  of  other  gases  in  a  fixed  proportion.  If  the   composition  of  air  alters  by  any  means;  it  is \nknown as air pollution, which can lead to effects o n human health, environment, and other living \ncreatures. According to The Air (Prevention and Con trol of Pollution) Act, 1981, “air pollution is \nthe presence of any solid, liquid, or gaseous subst ance in the atmosphere in such concentration as \nmay  be or tend to be injurious to human beings or o ther living  creatures or plants or property or \nenvironment”.  \nAir pollution has now become a serious issue of con cern and many of the  countries in the world \nsuch  as  Pakistan,  Iran,  India,  UAE,  and  China  etc.  are  formulating  strategies  to  deal  with  it. \nThere  are  a  number  of  factors  responsible  for  the  a ltered  composition  of  the  ambient  air  which \ncan be mainly categorised as natural causes and ant hropogenic (man-made) causes. 	\n2. Sources of air pollution 	\nNatural sources:  Natural sources  of  air pollution include volcanic  activity,  dust,  sea-salt, forest \nfires, lightening, soil outgassing  etc. \nAnthropogenic  sources:   These  sources  include  stationary  point  sources  ( e.g.  emission  from \nindustries),  mobile  sources  ( e.g.  vehicular  emission,  marine  vessels,  airplanes  etc.),  waste \ndisposal landfills, open burning  etc. 	\n3. Air pollutants 	\nThe substances which are responsible for causing ai r pollution are called as air pollutants.  \n3.1 Classification of air pollutants  \nAir pollutants can be categorized by various means:  \n 	\nAir Pollution\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	3 	\n3.1.1 On the basis of source of origin	 \n1.  Natural  air  pollutants:  Natural  air  pollutants  are  emitted  from  natural  sources  such  as \nvolcanic activity, dust, sea-salt, forest fires, li ghtening, soil outgassing etc. \n2.  Anthropogenic  air  pollutants:  These  pollutants  incl ude  the  emissions  from  stationary \npoint  sources  ( e.g.  emission  from  industries),  mobile  sources  ( e.g.  vehicular  emission, \nmarine vessels, airplanes  etc.), waste disposal landfills, controlled burning  etc. \n3.1.2 On the basis of method of origin\n \n1.  Primary  air  pollutants:  Those  pollutants  which  are  emitted  directly  from  any  emission \nsource in the atmosphere are termed as primary air  pollutants, e.g. sulphur dioxide (SO	\n2), \ncarbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), ammonia (NH	\n3)  etc.  \n2.  Secondary  air  pollutants:  Secondary  pollutants  are  formed  by  the  reactions  between \nprimary  air  pollutants  and  normal  atmospheric  const ituents.  In  some  of  the  cases,  these \npollutants are formed by utilizing the solar energy , e.g.  ozone, peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN), \nsmog  etc. \n3.1.3 On the basis of chemical composition	\n \n1.  Organic  air  pollutants:  Examples  are  hydrocarbons,  aldehydes,  ketones,  amines,  and \nalcohols  etc. \n2.  Inorganic air pollutants:  Examples are  carbon compo unds (CO and  carbonates), nitrogen \ncompounds  (NO	\nX  and  NH	3),  sulphur  compounds  (H	2S,  SO	2,  SO	3,  H	2SO	4),  halogen \ncompounds (HF, HCl  etc.), flyash, silica  etc. \n3.1.4 On the basis of state of matter	\n \n1.  Gaseous air  pollutants:  Pollutants which are in the  form of  gas are termed as  gaseous  air \npollutants,  e.g. SO	\n2, NO	X, O	3, CO  etc. \n2.  Particulate  air  pollutants:  Particulate  air  polluta nts  or  particulate  matter  (PM)  can  be \ndefined  as  the  microscopic  solid  or  liquid  matter  s uspended  in  the  earth’s  atmosphere. \nThere are various subtypes of particulate matter:\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	4 	\na.  Total  suspended  particulate  matter  (TSPM):  The  conc entration  of  particulate  matter \nwhich  is  obtained  when  a  high  volume  bulk  sampling  is  done  on  a  filter  substrate.  It \nincludes particles of all sizes. \nb.   PM	\n10: These are the particles less than 10 µ m in diamet er \nc.   PM\n2.5: These are the particles less than 2.5 µ m in diame ter \nd.   PM\n1.0: These are the particles less than 1 µ m in diamete r \nParticles  which  lie  between  10µ m  to  2.5µ m  are  terme d  as  ‘coarse  particles’  whereas  particles \nwith diameter less  than 2.5µ m are called as ‘fine  p articles’.  Fine particles  also  include ultra-fine \nparticles of size less than 0.1 µ m (PM	\n0.1).  \n3.2 Criteria pollutants  \nAccording  to  the  US  Environmental  Protection  Agency   (EPA),  criteria  pollutants  are  the \nparticulate  air  pollutants,  photochemical  oxidants  and  ground  level  ozone,  carbon  monoxide, \nsulphur  oxides,  nitrogen  oxides,  and  lead.  These  po llutants  are  responsible  for  causing  serious \nhealth  hazards,  environmental  hazards  such  as  smog,   acid  rain,  and  property  damage etc.  These \npollutants are termed as  criteria pollutants becaus e as per the Clean Air Act, 1963, US EPA sets \nnational  ambient  air  quality  standards  for  them  bas ed  on  the  human  health-based  and/or \nenvironmentally-based  criteria  (characterizations  o f  scientific  information).  The  sources  and \neffects of criteria pollutants are shown in the Tab le 1. \nTable 1: Criteria air pollutants – emission sources  and major effects   \nCriteria \npollutants  Emission sources  Major effects 	\nNatural \nsources  Anthropogenic \nsources  Health effects  Environmental \neffects 	\nSulfur  \ndioxide  \n(SO	\n2) Volcanic  \nemissions \nBurning  of  fossil \nfuels,  metal  \nsmelting,  petroleum  \nrefining \netc.  Respiratory \nproblems,  heart  and  \nlung  disorders,  \nvisual impairment  Acid rain  	\nNitrogen  \ndioxide \n(NO	\n2) \nLightning,  \nforest  fires  \netc.\n  Burning  of  fossil  \nfuels,  biomass  and  \nhigh  temperature  Pulmonary  \ndisorders,  increased  \nsusceptibility  to Precursor  of  ozone  \nformation  in  \ntroposphere,  aerosol\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	5 	\ncombustion  \nprocesses  respiratory \ninfections formation 	\nParticulate  \nmatter  \n(PM) Windblown  \ndust,  pollen  \nspores,  \nphotochemic\nally produced \nparticles  Vehicular  emissions,  \nindustrial  \ncombustion  \nprocesses, \ncommercial  and \nresidential \ncombustion, \nconstruction  \nindustries  Respiratory  \nproblems,  liver  \nfibrosis,  lung/liver  \ncancer, heart stroke, \nbone problems \nVisibility reduction \nCarbon  \nmonoxide  \n(CO) \nAnimal  \nmetabolism,  \nforest  fires, \nvolcanic \nactivity   Burning  of  \ncarbonaceus  fuels,  \nemission  from  IC \nengines \nAnoxemia  leading  \nto  various  \ncardiovascular \nproblems.

National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP) \nConsidering  the  serious  impacts  caused  by  air  pollu tants,  their  effective  management  becomes \ninevitable.  Therefore,  to  monitor  and  control  of  va rious  air  pollutants,  Central  Pollution  Control \nBoard  (CPCB)  has  been  provided  with  various  powers  and  functions  under  the  Air  (Prevention \nand  Control  of  Pollution)  Act,  1981.  Subsequent  to  this,  CPCB  had  launched  a  nationwide \nprogram  viz.  National  Ambient  Air  Quality  Monitoring  Programme  (NAAQM)  in  1984,  which \nhas  been  renamed  as  National  Air  Quality  Monitoring   Programme  (NAMP).  The  number  of \noperating  monitoring  stations  under  NAMP  has  increa sed  steadily  to  614  by  2016  covering  254 \ncities  across  the  nation  (29  states  and  5  UTs).  Und er  this  programme,  there  are  10  monitoring \nstations  functioning  in  Delhi.  Moreover,  under  the  NAMP,  three  major  pollutants viz.  sulphur \ndioxide  (SO	\n2),  nitrogen  dioxide  (NO	2),  and  particulate  matter  (PM	10)  have  been  identified  for \nregular  monitoring  at  all  the  locations.  Other  para meters  like  particulate  matter  (PM	\n2.5),  carbon \nmonoxide  (CO),  ammonia  (NH	\n3),  lead  (Pb),  ozone  (O	3),  benzene  (C	6H6),  benzo( ?)pyrene \n(B( ?)P),  arsenic  (As),  and  nickel  (Ni)  are  being  monito red  at  selected  locations  and  are  slowly \nbeing added to the monitoring networks under NAMP. 	\n5.  Source apportionment study  	\nTo  improve  the  air  quality  management  system,  there   is  also  the  need  of  knowing  the  particular \nsource  of  pollution  and  its  quantitative  contributi on  to  the  ambient  air  quality.  This  can  be  done \nthrough the  source apportionment study . There may be two ways for apportioning pollution,  (i) \nA  top-down  approach  starting  with  monitoring  of  pol lution,  and  (ii)  A  bottom-up  approach\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	7 	\nstarting  with  the  activity  data  (like  fuel  consumpt ion).  Source  apportionment  study  is  based  on \ntracking  down the sources through receptor  modeling  and it  helps in identifying the  sources and \nextent of their contribution.  	\n6.  National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)  	\nTo build-up a programme for the effective  management of ambient  air quality  and to reduce the \ndamaging  effects  of  air  pollution,  development  of  n ational  ambient  air  quality  standards \n(NAAQS)  is  a  pre-requisite.  Central  Pollution  Contr ol  Board  had  adopted  first  ambient  air \nquality  standards  on  November  11,  1982  as  per  the  S ection  16(2)  of  the  Air  (Prevention  and \nControl of Pollution)  Act, 1981. These standards  ha ve  been revised by CPCB in 1994, and later \nin 2009, which is shown in Table 2.  \nTable 2: National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NA AQS) – 2009 [1] \nPollutants  Time  weighted \naverage  Concentration in ambient air  Methods of measurement\n 	\nIndustrial, \nresidential\n, rural, \nand other \nareas  Ecologically \nsensitive area \n(notified by  Central \nGovernment) 	\nSulphur  dioxide  \n(SO	\n2), µ g/m	3  Annual* \n24 hours**  50 \n80 20 \n80 -Improved West and Gaeke \n-Ultraviolet fluorescence  	\nNitrogen dioxide	 	\n(NO	2), µ g/m	3 Annual* \n24 hours**  40  \n80 30 \n80 -Modified  Jacob  & \nHochheiser (Na-Arsenite) \n-Chemiluminescence 	\nParticulate  \nmatter (< 10 µ m)  \nor PM	\n10, µ g/m	3 Annual* \n24 hours**  60 \n100  60 \n100  -Gravimetric  \n-TOEM  \n-Beta attenuation 	\nParticulate  \nmatter  (<  2.5  \nµ m)  or  PM	\n2.5, \nµ g/m	\n3  Annual* \n24 hours**  40  \n60 40 \n60 -Gravimetric \n-TOEM  \n-Beta attenuation 	\nOzone  (O	3),  8 hours**  100  100  -UV photometric\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	8 	\nµ g/m	3  1 hour**  180  180  -Chemiluminescence \n-Chemical method 	\nLead (Pb), µ g/m	3  Annual* 24 hours**  0.50 \n1.0  0.50 \n1.0  -AAS/ICP  method  after  \nsampling  on  EPM  2000  or  \nequivalent filter paper  \n-ED-XRF using Teflon filter 	\nCarbon  \nmonoxide  (CO),  \nmg/m	\n3  8 hours** \n1 hour**  02  \n04 02 \n04 -Non  Dispersive  Infra  Red \n(NDIR) spectroscopy 	\nAmmonia  (NH	3), \nµ g/m	\n3  Annual* \n24 hours**  100  \n400 100 \n400 -Chemiluminescence \n-Indophenol blue method 	\nBenzene  (C	6H6), \nµ g/m	\n3  Annual*  05  05  -Gas  chromatography  based \ncontinuous analyzer  \n-Adsorption  and  desorption  \nfollowed by GC analysis 	\nBenzo(?)Pyrene \n(BaP)  –  \nparticulate  phase \nonly, ng/m	\n3  Annual*  01  01  -Solvent  extraction  followed \nby HPLC/GC analysis 	\nArsenic  (As),  \nng/m	\n3 Annual*  06  06  -AAS/ICP  method  after \nsampling  on  EPM  2000  or  \nequivalent filter paper 	\nNickel  (Ni),  \nng/m	\n3 Annual*  20  20  -AAS/ICP  method  after \nsampling  on  EPM  2000  or  \nequivalent filter paper 	\n* Annual arithmetic mean of minimum 104 measurement s in a year at a particular site taken twice a week \n24 hourly at uniform intervals.  \n**  24  hourly  or  08  hourly  or  01  hourly  monitored  va lues,  as  applicable,  shall  be  compiled  with  98%  of \nthe  time  in  a  year.  2%  of  the  time,  they  may  exceed   the  limits  but  not  on  two  consecutive  days  of \nmonitoring.   \nNote  –  Whenever  and  wherever  monitoring  results  on  two  consecutive  days  of  monitoring  exceed  the \nlimits  specified  above  for  the  respective  category,   it  shall  be  considered  adequate  reason  to  institute \nregular or continuous monitoring and further invest igation.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	9 \n \n 	\nDelhi,  with an  area  of 1483 km	2 [2],  is  geographically located in North  India with in the latitude \n28°24’17”  and  28°53’00’’N,  and  longitude  77°45’30’’   and  77°21’30’’E  [3].  Delhi  is  jointly \nadministered by the Central and State Government. A s of 2011, Delhi inhabitates approximately \n16.3  million  people;  thus  becoming  the  second  most  populous  city  and  second  most  populous \nurban  agglomeration  in  India.  Delhi  is  also  the  thi rd  largest  urban  area  in  the  world.  However, \ndue  to  rapid  development,  Delhi  is  also  facing  seri ous  challenges  in  terms  of  air  pollution.  To \ntackle the situation, Delhi has taken several steps  to reduce the air pollution level during the last \n10 years. However, more concerted efforts are still  required to reduce the pollution level.  	\n7. Air quality monitoring in Delhi 	\nAir quality monitoring in Delhi is carried out thro ugh a number of air quality monitoring stations \nsituated  across  the  territory.  The  monitoring  is  un dertaken  by  various  organizations viz.  Central \nPollution  Control  Board  (CPCB),  Delhi  Pollution  Con trol  Committee  (DPCC),  and  System  of \nAir  Quality  and  Weather  Forecasting  and  Research  (S AFAR)  of  Indian  Institute  of  Tropical \nMeteorology  (IITM),  Pune.  As  per  the  NAMP  of  CPCB,  manual  air  pollution  monitoring  is \ncarried out  at Sarojini Nagar, Chandni Chowk,  Mayap uri  Industrial  Area, Pritampura,  Shahadra, \nShahzada  Bagh,  Nizamuddin,  Janakpuri,  Siri  Fort,  an d  at  ITO  as  traffic  intersection  station \nacross  the  Delhi.  Apart  from  the  manual  air  monitor ing  stations,  continuous  ambient  air  quality \nmonitoring (CAAQM) stations of CPCB are also locate d at 11 locations viz. Anand Vihar, Civil \nLines,  DCE,  Dilshad  Garden,  Dwarka,  IGI  Airport,  IT O,  Mandir  Marg,  Punjabi  Bagh,  R.K. \nPuram,  and  Shadipur  across  the  city  (Figure  1).  DPC C  has  air  quality  monitoring  stations  at  6 \nlocations  viz. Civil lines, Punjabi Bagh, Mandir Marg, Anand Viha r ISBT, IGI Airport, and R.K. \nPuram.  In  addition  to  CPCB  and  DPCC,  there  are  8  mo nitoring  stations  of  SAFAR  at  various \nlocations  in  Delhi,  as  shown  in  figure  1,  to  monito r  the  ambient  air  quality  on  real  time  basis. \nThe  data  obtained  from  these  stations  are  also  used   for  the  determination  of  national  air  quality \nindex.  	\nAir Pollution in Delhi: An Analysis\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	10	 	\n 	\nFigure 1. Air quality monitoring stations of various organiza tions in Delhi  \n 	\n8.  Air quality trends in Delhi 	\nAir  quality  for  the  three  major  pollutants  (SO	2,  NO	2,  and  PM)  is  determined  to  understand  the \ntrend  of  pollution  in  Delhi  during  recent  years.  On   the  basis  of  annual  average  concentration  of \npollutants,  air  quality  trend  has  been  seen  for  the   years  2009  –  2015  along  with  the  comparison \nwith  existing  national  ambient  air  quality  standard s  (NAAQS),  2009.  It  can  be  seen  in  figure  2 \nthat among the three pollutants  viz. SO	\n2, NO	2, and PM	10, the concentration of NO	2 and PM	10 are \nfar  exceeding  the  prescribed  standard  limits.  The  c oncentration  of  SO	\n2  is  within  the  standard \nlimits.  However,  as  far  as  NO	\n2  is  concerned,  continuous  rise  in  concentration  was   observed  in \npast  7  years.  Moreover,  the  problem  of  particulate  matter  (PM	\n10)  is  more  critical.  Since  2009, \napproximately  258  –  335%  rise  has  been  observed  in  PM	\n10  concentration  compared  to  the\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	11	 	\nstandards.  Although  the  concentration  has  been  slig htly  lowered  down  since  2011,  but  it  is  still \nfar above the safe limits. \n \nFigure 	2. Air quality trends in Delhi (2009 – 2015) based on manual air quality monitoring stations 	\n(Source:CPCB)	 \n  \nApart from the annual average data, continuous  air  monitoring data  of  Delhi is also recorded by \nCPCB at 11 locations, as stated above. Out of 11, t he data of 8 operating monitoring stations for \nthe period of December 1 – 10, 2015 is shown in fig ure 3. This graph reflects the average values \nof  the  SO	\n2,  NO	2,  and  PM	2.5  concentration  for  the  period  of  10  days.  Since,  th e  standards  for \nambient  air  quality  are  only  suitable  for  the  data  based  on  time  weighted  average  of  annual  and \n24 hours/8 hours/1 hour, the comparison of the data  of 10 days average with the standards is not \nfeasible. However, it is quite evident from the gra ph that concentration of NO	\n2 and PM	2.5 is very \nhigh.  Among  all  the  locations,  NO	\n2  and  PM	2.5  concentration  is  least  at  Dwarka.  The \nconcentration  of  particulate  matter  (PM	\n2.5)  at  all  the  other  locations  needs  to  be  curbed  dow n \nurgently  as  the  values  recorded  are  very  high.  More over,  the  concentration  of  SO	\n2  is  acceptable \nat all the locations across Delhi.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	12	 	\n 	\nFigure 	3. Air  quality  trends  in  Delhi  (Dec.  1  –  10,  2015)  bas ed  on  the  data  of  continuous  air \nquality monitoring stations (	\nSource:CPCB)  	\n  \n8.1 Air quality index (AQI) in Delhi  \nAir quality index (AQI) is the tool to monitor air  quality in major urban cities across the country \non  a  real  –  time  basis  and  to  enhance  public  awaren ess.  The  AQI  developed  is  based  on  human \nexposure  and  health  effects  and  may  not  be  strictly   applicable  to  ecologically  sensitive  areas. \nVarious  pollutants  which  are  considered  for  AQI  det ermination  are  PM	\n10,  PM	2.5,  NO	2,  O	3,  CO, \nSO	\n2, NH	3, and Pb. The data  obtained from the online air qua lity  monitoring stations is  the  most \nsuitable for the AQI determination  as information o n AQI can be generated in real time.  For the \nease of understanding, colour bands are used to rep resent various AQI bands.  \nAQI  Associated health impacts 	\nGood (0 – 50)  Minimal impact 	\nSatisfactory (51 – 100)  Minor breathing discomfort  to sensitive people \nModerately polluted 	\n(101 – 200) Breathing  discomfort  to  people  with  lungs,  asthma, \nand  heart \ndiseases 	\nPoor (201 – 300)  Breathing discomfort to most peopl e on prolonged exposure 	\nVery poor (301 – 400)  Respiratory illness on prolonged exposure \nSevere (401 – 500)  Affects  healthy  people,  and  seri ously  impacts  those  with  existing \ndiseases\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	13	 	\n..\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	14	 	\nAs  per  the  AQI  bulletin  (January  2016),  PM	2.5  is  the  prominent  pollutant  in  Delhi  and \nneighbouring  areas  which  continuously  exceeds  the  s tandard  [4].  In  the  months  of  May  – \nOctober,  the  AQI  shows  that  air  quality  is  moderate ly  polluted.  However,  after  October,  the \nsituation becomes worse. The average AQI in the mon th of January was recorded as very poor to \nsevere.  Maximum  value  of  PM	\n2.5  is  recorded  as  296  µ g/m	3  during  January  2016  (at  IHBAS, \nDilshad Garden) which is far above the prescribed s tandard limit (60 µ g/m	\n3). There are a number \nof sources responsible for the particulate matter s uch as transport, road dust, gaseous combustion \netc .  Moreover,  the  sources  /  natural  causes  also  get  i nfluenced  by  the  meteorological  conditions \nprevailing in the neighbouring areas. 	\n9.  Air quality assessment in Delhi 	\nFor  the  ease  of  understanding  the  pollution  level,  air  quality  can  be  categorised  into  four  broad \ncategories on the basis of exceedance factor (EF),  viz. the ratio of annual mean concentration of a \npollutant  and  its  respective  standard.  Accordingly,   the  air  pollution  can  be  categorized  into  4 \ntypes as: \n·  Critical pollution (C)     : EF  ? 1.5; \n·   High pollution (H)         : 1.0  ? EF < 1.5; \n·   Moderate pollution (M) : 0.5  ? EF < 1.0; and \n·   Low pollution (L)          : EF < 0.5 \nBased on the data of SO	\n2, NO	2, and PM	10, the exceedance factors are calculated which is sh own \nin figure 4. It is evident from the figure that pol lution level for SO	\n2 is low. The pollution level in \ncase of NO	\n2 is high along with critical in few of the years. M oreover, the pollution level crosses \ncritical  level  for  PM	\n10 	in  all  the  years.  This  indicates  that  immediate  att ention  is  needed  to  curb \nthe particulate matter.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	15	 	\n 	\nFigure 4.	 Pollution level based on exceedance factor (EF) of  SO	2, NO	2, and PM	10 in Delhi \n 	\n10.   Source apportionment study in Delhi  	\nThe study shows that the concentration of pollutant s is continuously on the rise, especially in the \ncase  of  particulate  matter,  where  pollution  level  i s  critical.  Therefore,  source  apportionment \nstudy  for  the  particulate  matter  has  been  undertake n  for  assessing  the  contribution  of  various \npollution sources for the PM	\n10 and PM	2.5. In case of Delhi, the survey has been conducted b y IIT \nKanpur in coordination with Government of NCT of De lhi during winter and summer seasons at \nsix  characteristic  locations  –  Dwarka  (residential) ,  Rohini  (residential  and  industrial),  Okhla \n(industrial),  Vasantkunj  (residential-cum-commercia l),  Dilshad  garden  (industrial),  and  Pusa \nroad  (residential-cum-commercial),  for  assessing  th e  contribution  of  various  pollution  sources \nfor the PM	\n10 and PM	2.5. The idea of sampling in winter and summer months  is influenced by the \nfact  that  winter  conditions  provide  low  dispersion  and  high  concentrations  of  pollutants  while \nduring    the  summer  months,  meteorology  gets  improve d  leading  to  better  dispersion  conditions \nfor pollutants. Based on the study, following infor mation can be summarized: \nPM	\n10:  At  all  the  locations,  the  major  sources  for  PM	10  during  winter  months  are  biomass \nburning,  vehicular  emission,  soil  and  road  dust,  co al  and  flyash,  secondary  particles etc.  in\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	16	 	\ndifferent proportions.  Secondary  particles originat e from precursor  gases  such as, SO	2  and NO	2. \nVehicles  and  power  plants  are  largely  responsible  f or  NO	\n2  emission,  while  SO	2  emission  is \nmainly  attributed  by  large  power  plants  and  refiner ies  situated  in  the  upwind  direction  of  Delhi. \nApart from this, construction materials are also re sponsible for PM	\n10.    \nDuring  summer  months,  soil  and  road  dust,  coal  and  flyash,  secondary  particles,  solid  waste \nburning, and vehicular emissions are largely respon sible for PM	\n10, along with minor contribution \nfrom construction activities. Role of industrial po llution in the overall concentration of PM	\n10 is < \n1% at all the locations.  \nPM	\n2.5:  For  the  PM	2.5,  secondary  particles,  vehicular  emissions,  biomass   burning,  soil  and  road \ndust,  and  solid  waste  burning  are  largely  responsib le  in  winter  months.  Moreover,  coal  and \nflyash, soil and road dust, secondary particles are   the major factors responsible for PM	\n2.5 during \nsummer  months  along  with  the  other  sources.  Industr ial  pollution  contributes  to  <1  –  2%  at  all \nthe locations.  Large amount of flyash and dust duri ng summer  months may  be due to high wind \nspeed  and  high  temperature  leading  to  extremely  dry   conditions  which  make  dust  airborne. \nFurther, dust storms may also result in the re-susp ension of flyash and road/soil dust.  	\n11.  Conclusion  	\nBased  on  the  above  observations,  it  can  be  said  tha t  the  air  of  Delhi  is  polluted esp.  in  terms  of \nparticulates.  According  to  a  study,  vehicular  pollu tion  alone  contributes  about  72%  of  the  total \nair  pollution  load  in  Delhi  as  estimated  using  emis sion  factor  and  activity-based  approach \nrecommended  by  IPCC  [5].  However,  present  study  fin ds  that  it  is  not  only  the  vehicular \npollution,  rather,  domestic  pollution,  industrial  e mission,  road  dust,  and  garbage  burning  also \nhave  a  large  share  in  Delhi’s  total  pollution  load.   Furthermore,  construction  of  infrastructure \nincluding large residential complexes potentially c ontributes to the Delhi’s air pollution load.  \nStudy also finds that the concentration of SO	\n2 is well under control. This is due to phasing out  of \ndiesel  driven  buses,  reduction  of  sulphur  content  i n  diesel  by  about  90%,  and  implication  of \nBharat  Stage  IV  norms  in  vehicles  of  Delhi.  The  maj or  cause  of  rising  NO	\n2  concentration  in \nDelhi is increased traffic load.  In atmosphere, the  combination of nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O	\n3), \nand  hydrocarbons  leads  to  the  formation  of  NO	\n2.  Therefore  to  minimize  the  NO	2  pollution,  all\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	17	 	\nthe three components involved in its formation need s to be targeted. To substantiate the findings, \ntrend  of increasing  vehicular usage is shown  in  fig ure 5.  Since 2005  – 06  to 2014 – 15,  82.75% \nincrease  can  be  noted  in  the  number  of  registered  v ehicles  in  Delhi.  Moreover,  the  excessive \nusage  of  cars  and  motor  cycles  are  the  pertinent  ca uses  for  rising  vehicular  pollution  load.  This \ncorroborates  the  cause  of  increasing  NO	\n2  as  well  as  particulate  matter  concentration.  Parti culate \nmatter  (PM	\n10  and  PM	2.5)  emanates  especially  from  the  vehicular  exhausts;  particularly  diesel \nvehicles, road dust, and industrial activities such  as combustion processes, construction activities \netc .  	\n 	 	\nFigure 5.  Traffic load in Delhi 	\n(Source:Economic survey of Delhi 2014 – 15)    	\nTremendous  growth  of  industrial  sector  is  also  resp onsible  for  pollution.  As  per  the  report  of \nEconomic  Survey  of  Delhi  2014-15  [6],  there  are  8.9 3  lakhs  total  industrial  establishments \noperating  in  Delhi  according  to  6	\nth  Economic  Census  2013,  which  is  18.35%  more  than  th e \nnumber  of  establishments  according  to  5	\nth  Economic  Census  2005.  In  many  of  the  industries, \ninstalled  air  pollution  control  devices  are  found  i n  idle  conditions  which  lead  to  the  emission  of \npollutants  directly  into  the  atmosphere  without  any   filtration.  Further,  construction  of  short \nchimneys also restricts the polluting gases to esca pe into the upper layers of the atmosphere. \nTraffic congestion on the roads, although underesti mated, is another very important factor as far \nas  air  pollution  is  concerned.  As  it  is  evident  fro m  figure  5,  cars  and  jeeps  are  responsible  for  a \nmajor  share  of  Delhi’s  vehicular  load,  their  conges tion  on  the  roads  create  nuisance.  Moreover, \n4-wheelers  also  need  a  lot  of  space  for  parking.  Th is  further  reduces  the  space  on  the  roads\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	18	 	\nleading  to  high  frequency  of  traffic  jams.  To  reduc e  the  pollution  at  traffic  intersection  points, \ntime  clocks  have  been  installed  at  most  of  the  poin ts  in  the  city.  But  it  has  been  observed  that \nhardly  any  vehicle  owner  switches  off  the  engine  du ring  that  period.  Thus  fuel  is  continuously \nburned at a fixed place which further adds up in th e atmospheric pollution load. \nMeteorological issues  \nApart from the vehicular and industrial emissions,  local climatic and seasonal factors also affect \nthe air quality of Delhi. Delhi, being a land-locke d territory, is unable to dilute its emission using \nthe  moderating  effects  of  sea;  the  opportunity  avai led  by  other  metropolitan  cities,  such  as \nMumbai,  Kolkata,  and  Chennai.  Surrounded  by  the  reg ions  of  varied  climate,  Delhi  also \nrepresents  a  great  variability  in  the  seasonal  patt erns.  At  its  west,  there  is  Great  Indian  desert \n(Thar desert) of Rajasthan while in the north and e ast direction there are cool hilly regions. At its \nsouth,  there  are  central  hot  plains.  Thus,  Delhi  is   located  in  the  subtropical  belt  with  extremely \nscorching summers, moderate rainfall, and chilling  winters.  \nThe  winters  are  extremely  important  in  Delhi  as  it  is  dominated  by  cold,  dry  air,  and  ground \nbased inversion with low wind conditions, which are  responsible for increasing concentration of \npollutants  [7,  8].  High  concentration  of  pollutants   is  trapped  close  to  earth’s  surface  bacause  a \nlayer  of  warm  air  acts  as  a  lid  on  top  of  this  laye r.  Moreover,  dense  smog  formation  during \nwinter  months  has  also  been  witnessed  in  Delhi,  the   reason  of  which  is  vehicular  pollution  as \nwell  as  the  prevailing  meteorological  conditions  in   the  months  of  December  and  January. \nSimilarly,  wind  pattern  also  affects  the  weather  co nditions.  According  to  a  study,  during  the \nautumn  and  winter  months,  approximately  500  million   tons  of  crop  residues  are  burnt  in  Indo-\nGangetic plains [9]. The image in figure 6 (a) show s the biomass burning in the state of Punjab. \nThe  wind  blows  from  India’s  north  and  north-west  to   the  east  direction  during  winters  as \ndepicted  from  the  wind-rose  diagram  of  Delhi  (Figur e  6  b).  This  ultimately  results  in \ncombination of pollution and fog, leading to heavy  smog formation in Delhi esp. during winters. \nIn  summers,  although  there  is  no  inversion  phenomen on,  still  the  air  quality  gets  deteriorated \nbecause of the increased concentration of PM	\n10, which is due to dust. However, it becomes toxic \ndue to the coating of polluted emissions from vario us sources. Nevertheless, during rainy season \npollution level goes down due to dust suspension. T hus, air pollution in Delhi is a trans-boundary \nand climate induced phenomenon.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	19	 	\n 	\n(a)	 Image showing the biomass burning in Punjab (red do ts show the fires and plume) 	\nSource: NASA	 \n \n(b)	\n Wind-rose diagram of Delhi  	\nSource: Indian Meteorological Department, Ministry  of Earth Sciences	 \nFigure 6.

Measures adopted to improve the air quality of Delh i	 	\n12.1 Recent initiatives \n12.1.1. Odd even scheme  \nAn initiative (on trial basis) has been taken by Go vt. of NCT of Delhi to curb the air pollution by \napplying ‘Odd-even scheme’ on the 4-wheelers plying  on the roads (exempting a few) from Jan. \n1	\nst  –  15	th  and  Apr.  15	th  –  30	th, 2016.  The  scheme  proposed  to  run  the  vehicles  as  pe r  their \nregistration  numbers  on  alternate  days.  Vehicles  ha ving  registration  number  ending  with  an  odd \ndigit were allowed to run on the odd dates and  vice-versa. The ultimate aim of the scheme was to \nreduce the number of vehicles from the roads of Del hi. \nTo  assess  the  effect  of  this  scheme  on  the  air  qual ity  of  Delhi,  an  analysis  was  done  using  the \ndata  collected  by  CPCB  from  8  operational  CAAQMS  (4   of  CPCB  and  4  of  DPCC)  and  7 \nmanual  stations  of  CPCB  [10].  The  pollutants  studie d  include  PM	\n10,  PM	2.5,  SO	2,  benzene,  O	3, \nNO	\n2,  and  CO.  The  study  reveals  that  during  the  odd-eve n  period,  there  was  marked  increase  in \nthe pollutants concentration as compared to ‘pre –  odd even period’, for e.g. there can be seen 13 \n–  39%  rise  in  PM	\n10  concentration,  52  –  70%  rise  in  PM	2.5,  and  37  –  80%  rise  in  NO	2 \nconcentration  [10].  Other  pollutants  were  also  foun d  to  be  increasing.  No  definite  reason  could \nbe  determined  for  this,  however,  unclear  trend  and  wide  fluctuations  of  air  pollutants  can  be \nattributed  to  the  meteorological  factors  and  emissi ons  from  pollution  sources  other  than \ntransportation.  Moreover,  the  odd-even  scheme  effec t  might  also  be  diluted  due  to  coverage  of \nvery few vehicles under this scheme.	\n 	\n12.1.2.  Court directions \nA  number  of  directions  under  Section  18(1)(b)  of  th e  Air  (Prevention  and  Control  of  Pollution) \nAct,  1981  regarding  prevention,  control  or  abatemen t  of  air  pollution  and  improvement  of \nambient  air  quality  in  Delhi  and  National  Capital  R egion  (NCR)  were  issued  to  U.P.  Pollution \nControl  Board,  Haryana  Pollution  Control  Board,  Del hi  Pollution  Control  Committee,  and \nJhalana  Institutional  Area, Jaipur, Rajasthan  on De c. 29	\nth, 2015.

Recommendations/suggestions to improve the air qua lity of Delhi 	\nEven  after  taking  a  number  of  initiatives,  the  pollution  in  Delhi  is  rising  to  a  great  extent.  To \ntackle  the  problems  and  to  reduce  health  risks  gene rated  due  to  air  pollution,  immediate  steps \nneed to be taken. Therefore, following issues need  to be judiciously addressed at the earliest.  \n1.  For  the  development  of  the  country,  establishment  o f  new  industrial  units  can  not  be \ndowngraded; however,  effective  control  measures of  pollution, and  proper installation of \nair  pollution  control  devices  and  their  smooth  func tioning  must  be  ensured  before  the \nestablishment  of  any  industry.  After  the  establishm ent  of  industry,  proper  functioning  of \nthe installed controlling units must also be ensure d. \n2.  Emission  from  construction  industries  /  activities  can  be  minimized  by  adopting  best \npractices  such  as;  use  of  water  sprays  for  dust  sup pression,  creating  ridges  to  prevent \ndust,  compaction  of  disturbed  soil,  prevention  of  d umping  of  earth  materials  along  road \nside  etc. \n3.  Restrictions  may  be  imposed  over  the  number  of  vehi cles  owned  by  an/a \nindividual/family.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	23	 	\n4. Fines should be imposed for the parking of vehicles  on the roads. \n5.  Provision  of  parking  space  in  any  commercial  establ ishment/shopping \nmall/parks/residential apartments should be mandato ry. \n6.  There  should  be  strict  restrictions  on  old  pollutin g  vehicles  and  subsidies  may  be  given \non the vehicles running on cleaner fuels. \n7.  There should be strict checking of PUC certificates . \n8.  There should be uniformity in the fuel quality stan dards used across the country. \n9.  There should be more space for pedestrians and two  wheeler vehicles on the roads. \n10.  Up-gradation of public transport is necessary by im proving service quality, enhancing the \nnumber of buses, and better road management. \n11.  Improvement  in  traffic  signal  co-ordination  for  con tinuous  traffic  flow  to  reduce  traffic \njam and idling time can also help to minimize pollu tion. \n12.  Corporate firms/ government offices may draw up an  action plan to have bus/cab service \nfor their employees with reasonable rates. \n13.  Idea  of  working  in  different  shifts  for  corporate  f irms  /  government  offices  to  minimize \ntraffic at peak hours can be introduced.  \n14.  Strict  rules  should  be  imposed  for  proper  dumping  a nd  disposal  of  solid  waste,  since \nunregulated  burning  results  in  pile-up  of  smoke  and   particulate  matter  in  concentrated \nform  at one  place.  Regular functioning of all the i nstalled solid waste treatment facilities \nmust also be ensured.  \n15.  Vegetation cover should be increased along the high ways, road dividers, and busy traffic \nintersection points.  \n16.  Mass awareness should be increased through electron ic and print media for all age groups \ntowards  sustaining  the  environment  and  to  reduce  po llution.  Public  should  also  be \nmotivated for the use of public transport. \n17.  Research and development for the battery-run buses/ cars etc. needs to be promoted.\n\nENVIS Centre on Control of Pollution (Water, Air, & Noise) \n 	24	 	\nReferences: 	\n1.
